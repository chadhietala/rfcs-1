# Router Helpers & Modifiers

## Summary

This RFC introduces new router helpers and modifiers that represent a decomposition of functionality of what we commonly use `{{link-to}}` for. This RFC also deprecates the usage of `{{link-to}}` and `{{query-params}}` helpers. Below is a list of the new helpers:

```hbs
{{transition-to}}
{{root-url}}
{{url-for}}
{{is-active}}
{{is-loading}}
{{is-transitioning-in}}
{{is-transitioning-out}}
```

## Motivation

`{{link-to}}` is the primary way for Ember applications to transition from route to route in your application. While this works for a lot of cases there are some use cases that are not well supported or supported at all by the framework. Below is an enumeration of cases that `{{link-to}}` does not address.

### Anchor Tags

We currently do not have a good solution for transitioning solely based on HTML anchors defined in the templating layer. For instance let say you are using [Ember Intl](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl) to do internationalization for your application. Ember Intl uses the [ICU message format](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) for the actual translation strings and supports having HTML within the string. Now lets say you want to put a link in a translation string and have it work like `{{link-to}}` works. In that case you either have role your own solution or use something like [Ember-href-to](https://github.com/intercom/ember-href-to). Another example where this would be useful is that links within markdown produced by addons like [Ember-CLI-Showdown](https://github.com/gcollazo/ember-cli-showdown) would just work. API's like `RouterService#transitionTo` can transition an application using relative URLs and we have an opportunity to leverage this functionality to support this use case.

### Extensibility Of `{{link-to}}`

In 2.11 we moved `LinkComponent` from `private` to `public` largely because there was no other way to modify the behavior of `{{link-to}}` and it had effectively become de-facto public API. That being said, it is less than desirable to `reopen` or `extend` framework objects to gain access to the functionality to create some application specific primitive. For example [Ember Bootsrap](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/) extends the [`LinkComponent`](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/blob/master/addon/components/base/bs-dropdown/menu/link-to.js) and then layers more functionality on top of it. Addons would be better served if they had access to more primitive functionality.

### CSS Class Magic

`{{link-to}}` adds some convienent, yet not obvious, classes to the element. These classes are:

- `active`: applied to any `{{link-to}}` that is on the "active" path
- `disabled`: applied depending on the evaluation of `disabled=someBool`
- `loading`: applied if one or more of the models passed are `undefined`
- `ember-transitioning-in`: applied to links that are about to be `active`
- `ember-transitioning-out`: applied to links that are about to be deactivated

The issue with these class names is that they are not declared anywhere in your templated and are provided by the `LinkComponent` as `classNameBindings`. This effectively creates a set of reserved class names that are highly prone to colissions in your typical application.

Furthermore, addons like [ember-cli-active-link-wrapper](https://github.com/alexspeller/ember-cli-active-link-wrapper) and [ember-bootstarp-nav-link](https://github.com/zoltan-nz/ember-bootstrap-nav-link) do a ton of work arounds to get things like the `.active` class to show up on wrapping elements instead of the element directly. This is a great example that shows we are missing some primitives.

### Default Query Param Serialization

Lastly, `{{link-to}}` has very strange behavior when it comes to serializing query params. On a controller you declare the query params for a specific route. These query params can have defaults for them. For example if you have a controller that looks like:

```js
// app/controllers/profile.js
import Controller from '@ember/controller';

export default Controller.extend({
  queryParams: ['someBool'],
  someBool: true,
})
```

and you to link to it like this:

```hbs
{{#link-to 'profile'}}Profile{{/link-to}}
```

In the DOM you will have an `href` on the anchor that gets serializes as:

```html
<a href="/profile?someBool=true" class="active ember-view">Profile</a>
```

Looking at a template you would have no idea that rendering the `{{link-to}}` would result in the query params being serialized. From an implementation point of view, this is problematic as we are forced to `lookup` the `Route` and the associated `Controller` to grab the query params. This can add a non-trivial amount of overhead during rendering, especially if you have many `{{link-to}}`s on a route that link many different parts of your application. As a side-note, this is one of the things  that needs to be delt with if we are ever to kill controllers.

### Does Not Work With Angle Bracket Invocation

Since angle bracket invocation does not support positional params, `{{link-to}}` has to adapt it's public API.

## Detailed design

Below is a detailed design of all of the template helpers and modifiers.

### `{{transition-to}}` Element Modifier

```hbs
<a {{transition-to routeName model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}>Profile</a>
```

`{{transition-to}}` is an element modifier that transitions the router to a new route when a user interacts with it. When installed on an anchor tag it will generate the url and set it as the `href` exactly how `{{url-for}}` would generate a url. When a user clicks or taps on the link, the event will be handled by Ember's global [`EventDispatcher`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.EventDispatcher).

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_: Optionally pass key value pairs that will be serialized
- **`data`** _Object_: Optionally pass a metadata key value pairs that will be attached to the transition at `Transition.data`. See below.
- **`replace`** _Boolean_: Optionally pass a boolen to replace the current entry in the browser's history. By default `replace` is `false`.


#### Passing Data To Transition

`{{transition-to}}` takes a new option `data` that allows you to add metadata to the `Transition` object. For instance if you were instrumenting your application with Google Analytics you could use this in conjunction with the routing service to understand the attribution of a transition.

```hbs
<a {{transition-to 'people.index' data=(hash attribution="edit.continue.button")}}>Continue >></a>
```

Then using the routing service's `routeDidChange` events you can intercept this data on the transition.

```js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Route.extend({
  router: service('router'),
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.router.on('routeDidChange', transition => {
      ga.send('pageView', {
        from: transition.from ? transition.from.name : 'initial',
        to: transition.to.name,
        attribution: transition.data.attribution
      });
    });
  }
})
```

#### `transitionTo` updates

`transitionTo` has always synchronously returned a new `Transition` instance however it was the responsibility of the caller to insert `data` onto the `Transition` instance. To align the declarative API with the imperative API, this RFC proposes that `transitionTo` allows you to pass data in the options of `transitionTo` that will be set on the `Transition` during construction time.

```ts
interface Options {
  queryParams?: Dict<string|number>,
  data?: Dict<string|number>
}

interface Router /* Route, RouterService */ {
  //...
  transitionTo(routeName: string, models?: string|number|object, options?: Options): Transition;
}
```

#### `Transition.data` integrity

The data in a `Transition` is guaranteed to be carried through the completion of the route transition. This includes `abort`s, `redirect`s and `retry`s of the transition.

### URL Generation Helpers

### `{{root-url}}` Helper

`{{root-url}}` simply returns the value from `Application.rootURL`. It can be used to prefix any `href` values you wish to hard code.

```hbs
<a href="{{root-url}}profile">Profile</a>
```

Will result in the following for the default configuration:

```html
<a href="/profile">Profile</a>
```

#### Signature Explainer

`{{root-url}}` does not take any parameters.

### `{{url-for}}` Helper

```hbs
{{url-for routeName model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}
```

`{{url-for}}` generates a root-relative URL as a string (which will include the application's rootUrl).

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_: Optionally pass key value pairs that will be serialized

_Returns_
- _String_: a root-relative URL as a string (which will include the application's `rootUrl`)

### Route State Helpers

### `{{is-active}}` Helper

```hbs
{{is-active 'people.index' model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}
```

The arguments to `{{is-active}}` have the same semantics as `{{url-for}}`, however the return value is a boolean. This should provide the same logic that determines whether to put an `active` class on a `{{link-to}}`.

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_: Optionally pass key value pairs that will be used to determine if the route is active.

_Returns_
- _Boolean_: Determines if the route is active or not.

### `{{is-loading}}` Helper

```hbs
{{is-loading 'people.index' model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}
```

The arguments to `{{is-loading}}` have the same semantics as `{{url-for}}` and `{{is-active}}`, however if any of the model(s) passed to it are unresolved e.g. evaluate to `undefined` the helper will return `true`, otherwise the helper will return `false`. This should provide the same logic that determines whether to put an `loading` class on a `{{link-to}}`.

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_: Optionally pass key value pairs that will be used to determine if the route is loading.

_Returns_
- _Boolean_: Determines if the route is loading or not.

### `{{is-transitioning-in}}` Helper

```hbs
{{is-transitioning-in 'people.index' model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}
```

The arguments to `{{is-transitioning-in}}` have the same semantics as all the other route state helpers, however `{{is-transitioning-in}}` only returns `true` when the route is going from an non-active to an active state. This should provide the same logic that determines whether to put an `ember-transition-in` class on a `{{link-to}}`.

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_:  Optionally pass key value pairs that will be used to determine if the route is transitioning in.

_Returns_
- _Boolean_: Determines if the route is transitioning in.

### `{{is-transitioning-out}}` Helper

```hbs
{{is-transitioning-out 'people.index' model queryParams=(hash a=a)}}
```

`{{is-transitioning-out}}` is just the inverse of `{{is-transitioning-in}}`.

#### Signature Explainer

Using the example above:

_Positional Params_
- **`routeName`** _String_: A fully-qualified name of this route, like `"people.index"`
- **`model`** _...Object|Array|Number|String_: Optionally pass an arbitrary amount of models to use for generation

_Named Params_
- **`queryParms`** _Object_:  Optionally pass key value pairs that will be used to determine if the route is transitioning out.

_Returns_
- _Boolean_: Determines if the route is transitioning out.

### Event Dispatcher Changes

In the past, only `HTMLAnchorElement`s that were produced by `{{link-to}}`s would produce a transition when a user clicked on them. This RFC changes to the global `EventDispatcher` to allow for any `HTMLAnchorElement` with a valid root relative `href` to cause a transition. This will allow for us to not only allows us to support use cases like the ones described in the [motivation](#anchor-tags), it makes teaching easier since people who know HTML don't need know an Ember specific API to participate in routing transitions.

#### Route Globs And Route Blacklisting

While the vast majority of the time developers want root relative URLs to cause a transition there are cases where you want root relative urls to cause a normal HTTP navigation. In the router map you can define [wildcard / globbing](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/defining-your-routes/#toc_wildcard--globbing-routes) that makes this problematic as any root relative url can be catched by a wildcard route. To solve this issue this RFC proposes expanding the route options to allow for a black list of urls that are allowed to cause a normal HTTP navigation.


```js
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('not-found', { path: '/*path', blacklist: ['/contact-us', '/order/:order_id'] });
});
```

When an event comes into the `EventDispatcher` we will cross check the blacklist to see if the event should be let through to the browser or if it should be handled internally.

### Deprecation of `{{link-to}}`

This RFC explodes out all of the functionality of `{{link-to}}` into a series of helpers. Since `{{link-to}}` was added to Ember it has grown naturally and unfortunately has added features that are non-performant and are not required by all applications. Because us this we plan to deprecate `{{link-to}}` and provide a [codemod](#migration-path) for migrating all instance of `{{link-to}}` to the corresponding helpers.

### Deprecation of `{{query-params}}`

This RFC introduces APIs that take `queryParams` as a named parameter and thus `{{query-params}}` is not needed as a stand alone helper.

### Deprecation of Default Query Param Serialization

As mentioned in the motivation, we want do not want to lookup the corresponding controller to serialize the default query param values. This means that any query params that you want to be serialized must be passed directly into the corresponding helper. As part of the migration **only** query params that were declared with `{{query-params}}` will be migrated.

## Migration Path

Since `{{link-to}}` is static we can write a codemod using [Ember Template Recast](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast) to migrate the code. Below are numerous before and after examples of how the codemod would migrate.

### Basic `{{link-to}}`

**Before:**

```hbs
{{#link-to 'profile' class="profile"}}Profile{{/link-to}}
{{link-to 'About' 'about'}}
```

**After:**

```hbs
<a href={{url-for 'profile'}} class="profile">Profile</a>
<a href={{url-for 'about'}}>About</a>
```

### With Model `{{link-to}}`

**Before:**

```hbs
{{#link-to 'profile' this.profile class="profile"}}Profile{{/link-to}}
{{link-to 'About' 'about' this.contact}}
```

**After:**

```hbs
<a href={{url-for 'profile' this.profile}} class="profile">Profile</a>
<a href={{url-for 'about' this.contact}}>About</a>
```

### With Query Params `{{link-to}}`

**Before:**

```hbs
{{#link-to 'post' this.post (query-params order="CHRON")}}{{this.post.name}}{{/link-to}}
```

**After:**

```hbs
<a href={{url-for 'post' this.post queryParms=(hash order="CHRON")}}>{{this.post.name}}</a>
```

### With Replace `{{link-to}}`

**Before:**

```hbs
{{#link-to 'post' this.post replace=true}}{{this.post.name}}{{/link-to}}
```

**After:**

```hbs
<a {{transition-to 'post' this.post replace=true}}>{{this.post.name}}</a>
```

One of the tricker parts about this migration is knowing how the autogenerated CSS classes are being used. Because of this, adding the route state helpers must explicitly be turned on in the codemod. For instance if you are making heavy use of the `.active` class, you will be suited best by turning pass the codemod the correct configuration to do a transform like the following:

**Before**

```hbs
{{#link-to 'profile'}}Profile{{/link-to}}
```

**After**

```hbs
<a href={{url-for 'profile'}} class={{is-active 'active'}}>Profile</a>
```

## How we teach this

In many ways this vastly simplifies the Ember's approach to linking within the app. It removes the requirement for a proprietary API and instead embraces the power of URLs.

In the cases where you do need to do more complicated things like pass in memory models to a route, things should feel very similar to `{{link-to}}` as they have the exact same signature. In the case of query param serialization, I believe we are actually aligning a mental model as to how URL generation should work.

## Drawbacks

This RFC expands the surface area of the templating layer by exposing the primitives that make up `{{link-to}}`. This may cause confusion of choosing between using simple basic anchor tags, `{{url-for}}` and `{{transition-to}}`, however I believe that each one of the these APIs are solving a real problem that we have in Ember today.

By proxy this may cause people to encapsulate all of these primitives into a single component and thus creating a user-land version of `{{link-to}}`. This could be seen as a framework misstep if the majority of applications end up depending on the addon.

## Alternatives

We could just start deprecating and removing functionality from `{{link-to}}` it self. That being said, it is hard to understand how much of the community is reliant on certain feature of `{{link-to}}`. This also doesn't help with usecases like the i18n and markdown use cases.

## Unresolved questions

TBD?
